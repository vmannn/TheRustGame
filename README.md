# TheRustGame (Snake game with a twist)

This is a simple snake game implemented with an interesting twist. The game features the traditional style in which one
travels as a snake and collects apples. The twist is that there are poisonous apples as well which are designed to be very similar to 
the original apple. The only difference is a small tint in color. As you collect the regular apples, more and more poisonous apples appear
on the screen. The score is currently displayed in the terminal. A fun challenge.


# How to run game

clone the repository, cd into the directory from a terminal or IDE and simply use "cargo run" to play.


# Future plans

Make the score onscreen. I would also like to seperate the game by levels. Perhaps more poisonous apples will appear at a time. Maybe 
even moving apples. Shortage of time was a factor.
